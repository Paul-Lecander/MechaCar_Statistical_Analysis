To determine which variables were able to provide a non-random amount of variance, the P-Value was assessed for each variable. A variable with a P-Value, denoated as "Pr(>|t|)" in figure 1, less than 0.05 is deemed to provide a non-random amount of variance. The variables with a P-Value of less than 0.05 are vehicle length and groud clearance.

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
??It is considered to be zero (p < 0.01)
Determining the correlation of the linear regression was performed, see Figure 1, and gave a multiple R-squared value of 0.71 which is a strong and positive correlation. The slope of the linear model is considered to be non-zero because of the coefficients, listed below in figure 2, do not equal 0. </br>

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
-The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance 
of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current
manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing 
lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
-briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. 
Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. 
In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: 
for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

-What metric or metrics are you going to test?
-What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
-What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
-What data is needed to run the statistical test?
